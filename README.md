# Cyber-Yantra
In the digital age, safeguarding sensitive information is paramount. This paper examines Cyber Yantra, a lightweight encryption tool employing a substitution cipher mechanism for basic text confidentiality. While traditional substitution ciphers, such as the Caesar Cipher, are foundational to cryptography, their susceptibility to frequency analysis and known-plaintext attacks remains a critical vulnerability. Contemporary research emphasizes augmenting classical methods with randomized key matrices and polyalphabetic strategies to mitigate predictable patterns [1][2]. Cyber Yantra integrates dynamic key-based substitutions and modular arithmetic to balance simplicity and security, targeting educational and low-resource environments where advanced cryptographic protocols are impractical. The study evaluates its security posture, highlighting inherent risks such as limited key-space exposure to brute-force decryption and potential algorithmic weaknesses. Despite these limitations, the tool serves as an effective pedagogical instrument for illustrating core cryptographic principles and fostering foundational cybersecurity skills. Future enhancements propose hybridizing substitution mechanisms with advanced encryption standard such as AES-inspired key expansion and incorporating randomized transposition layers to fortify resilience against modern cryptanalytic techniques. By bridging classical and contemporary approaches, Cyber Yantra underscores the potential of optimized substitution ciphers in niche applications, aligning with evolving lightweight cryptographic frameworks as recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology [3]. This work contributes to the ongoing dialogue on lightweight encryption by offering insights into balancing educational utility with security imperatives in resource-constrained scenarios.
