Create a Streamlit application that presents a comprehensive view of the Cyber Yantra encryption tool and its significance in secure communication. The app should be interactive, visually appealing, and informative. It should include the following components:

1. Home Page
A brief introduction to Cyber Yantra and its purpose.

An engaging hero section with an eye-catching title, description, and an image (related to cybersecurity/encryption).

A sidebar navigation menu to access different sections.

2. Research Overview
A summary of the research paper, including:

Objectives of the Cyber Yantra tool

How it enhances encryption

Its role in modern cybersecurity

Use Markdown or Streamlit components to structure the content clearly.

3. Importance of Secure Communication
Explain why secure communication is critical in todayâ€™s world.

Use real-life case studies of cyberattacks and breaches (e.g., data leaks, man-in-the-middle attacks).

Provide statistics and visuals (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) using Matplotlib or Plotly.

4. Cyber Yantra Encryption Mechanism
Explain the working mechanism of Cyber Yantra in an easy-to-understand manner.

Use diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate encryption and decryption processes.

Option to upload a file or input text and see how Cyber Yantra encrypts it dynamically.

5. Case Studies and Real-Life Applications
Present real-life examples where encryption tools like Cyber Yantra are needed.

Compare Cyber Yantra with other encryption techniques (AES, RSA, etc.) using a comparison table.

A section where users can simulate an encryption scenario and see the impact of security breaches.

6. Interactive Data Visualizations
Show a timeline of major cybersecurity breaches using an interactive graph.

Use word clouds to highlight cybersecurity threats.

Allow users to interact with datasets related to encryption and cyber threats.

7. Conclusion & Future Scope
Discuss how Cyber Yantra can evolve in the future.

Mention potential improvements and real-world applications.
