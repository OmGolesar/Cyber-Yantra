    ### Brute Force Attack Scenario
    
    In this attack, the adversary attempts to decrypt the message by trying all possible keys.
    
    **Simulation Results:**
    
    | Encryption Method | Time to Crack | Outcome |
    |-------------------|---------------|---------|
    | Caesar Cipher     | Seconds       | ‚ùå Easily broken |
    | Cyber Yantra (Basic) | Minutes   | ‚ùå Vulnerable with computing power |
    | Cyber Yantra (Polyalphabetic) | Hours to days | ‚ö†Ô∏è More resistant but still vulnerable |
    | AES-256          | Billions of years | ‚úÖ Practically impossible |
    
    **Why Cyber Yantra is better than basic Caesar cipher:**
    - Dynamic key generation adds an initial barrier
    - Polyalphabetic version requires testing many more combinations
    - More structured implementation reduces implementation vulnerabilities
    
    **Recommendation:**
    For protection against brute force attacks in critical applications, use industry-standard
    encryption with large key spaces (AES, RSA).

elif selected_scenario == "Frequency Analysis Attack":
    st.markdown("""
    ### Frequency Analysis Attack Scenario
    
    In this attack, the adversary analyzes the frequency of characters in the ciphertext to
    deduce the encryption key based on known language patterns (e.g., 'E' is the most common letter in English).
    
    **Simulation Results:**
    
    | Encryption Method | Vulnerability Level | Outcome |
    |-------------------|---------------------|---------|
    | Caesar Cipher     | Very High           | ‚ùå Easily broken with sufficient text |
    | Cyber Yantra (Basic) | High             | ‚ùå Vulnerable with sufficient text |
    | Cyber Yantra (Polyalphabetic) | Medium  | ‚ö†Ô∏è More resistant but not immune |
    | Modern Encryption (AES, etc.) | Very Low | ‚úÖ Not vulnerable to this attack |
    
    **Why Cyber Yantra is better than basic Caesar cipher:**
    - Polyalphabetic version disrupts single-letter frequency patterns
    - Multiple keys create more complex statistical patterns
    - Implementation details can add confusion to the ciphertext
    
    **Recommendation:**
    For protection against frequency analysis in applications requiring confidentiality,
    use modern encryption standards or enhance Cyber Yantra with additional obfuscation techniques.

    ### Known-Plaintext Attack Scenario
    
    In this attack, the adversary has access to both the plaintext and its encrypted version,
    allowing them to determine the encryption key.
    
    **Simulation Results:**
    
    | Encryption Method | Vulnerability Level | Outcome |
    |-------------------|---------------------|---------|
    | Caesar Cipher     | Very High           | ‚ùå Trivially broken |

    | Cyber Yantra (Polyalphabetic) | Medium  | ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex but still vulnerable |
    | Modern Encryption (AES, etc.) | Low      | ‚úÖ Resistant to basic known-plaintext attacks |
    
    **Why Cyber Yantra is better than basic Caesar cipher:**
    - Polyalphabetic version requires more plaintext-ciphertext pairs
    - Session-specific keys limit the usefulness of past known plaintexts
    
    **Recommendation:**
    For applications where adversaries might have access to plaintext-ciphertext pairs,
    use modern encryption standards with key derivation functions and initialization vectors.

    ### Man-in-the-Middle Attack Scenario

    | Encryption Method | Protection Level | Outcome |

    | Cyber Yantra (Basic) | Low           | ‚ùå Limited protection against casual interception |
    | Cyber Yantra (Enhanced) | Low to Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è Better but still vulnerable to sophisticated attacks |
    | TLS/SSL with Modern Encryption | High | ‚úÖ Strong protection with authentication |
    
    **Why Cyber Yantra is better than basic Caesar cipher:**
    - More complex implementation can include integrity checks
    - Dynamic key generation adds a layer of security

    For protection against MITM attacks, combine encryption with digital signatures,
    message authentication codes, and secure key exchange protocols.
