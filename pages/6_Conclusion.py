st.subheader("Summary of Cyber Yantra")

st.markdown("""
Cyber Yantra represents an educational bridge between classical cryptographic methods and modern encryption standards.
As demonstrated throughout this application, it enhances traditional substitution ciphers by incorporating:

1. **Dynamic key generation** for increased unpredictability
2. **Modular arithmetic operations** for consistent encryption/decryption
3. **Polyalphabetic enhancements** to mitigate frequency analysis vulnerabilities
4. **Preservation of non-alphabetic characters** for format maintenance

While not suitable for high-security applications, Cyber Yantra serves valuable purposes in educational
contexts, resource-constrained environments, and as a foundational learning tool for encryption concepts.

### Concluding Thoughts

The field of cryptography continues to evolve as computational capabilities advance and new threats emerge.
While tools like Cyber Yantra have specific educational and niche applications, they also highlight an
important principle in security: understanding fundamental concepts is essential for developing and
implementing more advanced solutions.

As we navigate an increasingly digital world, the need for both basic literacy in encryption concepts
and sophisticated security implementations will only grow. Cyber Yantra contributes to this ecosystem
by making encryption principles more accessible and demonstrating how classical techniques can be
enhanced to meet contemporary challenges.

The journey from simple substitution ciphers to quantum-resistant cryptography is a testament to
human ingenuity in the ongoing effort to secure our digital communications and protect sensitive information.
